Datasets: 

HouseAllocationInstances: consist of 1000 valuation matrices with n=6 and m=11. The valuations are generated uniformly at random from 1 to 10. 
Single-Peaked Preferences: consist of 1000 valuation matrices for each pair of (n, m), where n =10 and 10 <= m <= 25. The peak houses are selected uniformly at random for each agent. 
Single-Dipped Preferences: consist of 1000 valuation matrices for each pair of (n, m), where n =10 and 10 <= m <= 25. The dip houses are selected uniformly at random for each agent.
